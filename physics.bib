	abstract = {In order to assess the capability to optically identify small marine microbes, both simulations and experiments of angular resolved light scattering  {(ARLS)} were performed. After calibration with 30-nm vesicles characterized by a nearly constant scattering distribution for vertically polarized light (azimuthal angle=90Â°), {ARLS} from suspensions of three types of marine picoplankton (two prokaryotes and one eukaryote) in seawater was measured with a scattering device that consisted of an elliptical mirror, a rotating aperture, and a {PMT.} Scattered light was recorded with adequate signal-to-noise in the 40-140Â°. Simulations modeled the cells as prolate spheroids with independently measured dimensions. For the prokaryotes, approximated as homogeneous spheroids, simulations were performed using the {RM} {(Rayleigh-Mie)} - I method, a hybrid of the {Rayleigh-Debye} approximation and the generalized {Lorentz-Mie} theory. For the picoeukaryote, an extended {RM} - I method was developed for a coated
spheroid with different shell thickness distributions. The picoeukaryote was
then modeled as a coated sphere with a spherical core. Good overall
agreements were obtained between simulations and experiments. The
distinctive scattering patterns of the different species hold promise for an
identification system based on {ARLS.}},

	abstract = {The experimental determination of scattered electromagnetic radiation from a known target illuminated by a known source remains an essential tool to test new scattering theories and to investigate the scattering by particles for which a theory has not yet been devised. This article describes a modern broad-band microwave scattering facility capable of determining the elements of the scattering matrix from 0 to 168 Â° scattering angle under automated control. The laboratory measurements can cover the size range from near the Rayleigh limit to geometric optics. Both phase and intensity are routinely measured at 85â€“501 discrete wavelengths from 2.7 to 4 mm, which allows the derivation of all elements in the scattering matrix. The unwanted background radiation can be removed through vector subtraction and the result verified using the technique of â€œtime-gatingâ€ based on inverse Fourier transformation and time domain analysis. Measurements are shown to be repeatable and accurate. This is primarily due to the use of a â€œcleanâ€ mechanical and electronic design in combination with high mechanical and thermal stability.},
