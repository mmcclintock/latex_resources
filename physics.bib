	abstract = {In order to assess the capability to optically identify small marine microbes, both simulations and experiments of angular resolved light scattering  {(ARLS)} were performed. After calibration with 30-nm vesicles characterized by a nearly constant scattering distribution for vertically polarized light (azimuthal angle=90°), {ARLS} from suspensions of three types of marine picoplankton (two prokaryotes and one eukaryote) in seawater was measured with a scattering device that consisted of an elliptical mirror, a rotating aperture, and a {PMT.} Scattered light was recorded with adequate signal-to-noise in the 40-140°. Simulations modeled the cells as prolate spheroids with independently measured dimensions. For the prokaryotes, approximated as homogeneous spheroids, simulations were performed using the {RM} {(Rayleigh-Mie)} - I method, a hybrid of the {Rayleigh-Debye} approximation and the generalized {Lorentz-Mie} theory. For the picoeukaryote, an extended {RM} - I method was developed for a coated
spheroid with different shell thickness distributions. The picoeukaryote was
then modeled as a coated sphere with a spherical core. Good overall
agreements were obtained between simulations and experiments. The
distinctive scattering patterns of the different species hold promise for an
identification system based on {ARLS.}},

	abstract = {The experimental determination of scattered electromagnetic radiation from a known target illuminated by a known source remains an essential tool to test new scattering theories and to investigate the scattering by particles for which a theory has not yet been devised. This article describes a modern broad-band microwave scattering facility capable of determining the elements of the scattering matrix from 0 to 168 ° scattering angle under automated control. The laboratory measurements can cover the size range from near the Rayleigh limit to geometric optics. Both phase and intensity are routinely measured at 85–501 discrete wavelengths from 2.7 to 4 mm, which allows the derivation of all elements in the scattering matrix. The unwanted background radiation can be removed through vector subtraction and the result verified using the technique of “time-gating” based on inverse Fourier transformation and time domain analysis. Measurements are shown to be repeatable and accurate. This is primarily due to the use of a “clean” mechanical and electronic design in combination with high mechanical and thermal stability.},

	abstract = {The possibility of using plasmonic and metamaterial covers to drastically reduce the total scattering cross section of spherical and cylindrical objects is discussed. While it is intuitively expected that increasing the physical size of an object may lead to an increase in its overall scattering cross section, here we see how a proper design of these lossless metamaterial covers near their plasma resonance may induce a dramatic drop in the scattering cross section, making these objects nearly “invisible” or “transparent” to an outside observer—a phenomenon with obvious applications for low-observability and noninvasive probe design. Physical insights into this phenomenon and some numerical results are provided.},
