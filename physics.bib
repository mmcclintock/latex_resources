	abstract = {In order to assess the capability to optically identify small marine microbes, both simulations and experiments of angular resolved light scattering  {(ARLS)} were performed. After calibration with 30-nm vesicles characterized by a nearly constant scattering distribution for vertically polarized light (azimuthal angle=90Â°), {ARLS} from suspensions of three types of marine picoplankton (two prokaryotes and one eukaryote) in seawater was measured with a scattering device that consisted of an elliptical mirror, a rotating aperture, and a {PMT.} Scattered light was recorded with adequate signal-to-noise in the 40-140Â°. Simulations modeled the cells as prolate spheroids with independently measured dimensions. For the prokaryotes, approximated as homogeneous spheroids, simulations were performed using the {RM} {(Rayleigh-Mie)} - I method, a hybrid of the {Rayleigh-Debye} approximation and the generalized {Lorentz-Mie} theory. For the picoeukaryote, an extended {RM} - I method was developed for a coated
spheroid with different shell thickness distributions. The picoeukaryote was
then modeled as a coated sphere with a spherical core. Good overall
agreements were obtained between simulations and experiments. The
distinctive scattering patterns of the different species hold promise for an
identification system based on {ARLS.}},
